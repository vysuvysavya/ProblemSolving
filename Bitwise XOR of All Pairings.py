You are given two 0-indexed arrays, nums1 and nums2, consisting of non-negative integers. There exists another array, nums3, which contains the bitwise XOR of all pairings of integers between nums1 and nums2 (every integer in nums1 is paired with every integer in nums2 exactly once).

Return the bitwise XOR of all integers in nums3.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [2,1,3], nums2 = [10,2,5,0]
Output: 13
Explanation:
A possible nums3 array is [8,0,7,2,11,3,4,1,9,1,6,3].
The bitwise XOR of all these numbers is 13, so we return 13.
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 0
Explanation:
All possible pairs of bitwise XORs are nums1[0] ^ nums2[0], nums1[0] ^ nums2[1], nums1[1] ^ nums2[0],
and nums1[1] ^ nums2[1].
Thus, one possible nums3 array is [2,5,1,6].
2 ^ 5 ^ 1 ^ 6 = 0, so we return 0.

========================

class Solution:
    def xorAllNums(self, nums1, nums2):
        c1 = len(nums1)
        c2 = len(nums2)
        x1 = 0
        x2 = 0
        if c1 % 2 != 0:
            for i in nums2:
                x2 ^= i
        if c2 % 2 != 0:
            for i in nums1:
                x1 ^= i
        return x1 ^ x2

==========

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to analyze the XOR operation properties and leverage mathematical patterns. Specifically:

XOR is commutative and associative, meaning the order of operations doesn't matter.
Any number XORed with itself results in 0.
For every even occurrence, the XOR cancels out (e.g., ( x \oplus x = 0 )).
Given these properties, the XOR of all pairings can be simplified:

If the length of one array is even, all XOR contributions from that array cancel out.
If the length is odd, only the XOR of the elements of the other array matters.
Approach
Detailed Explanation
Calculate the XOR of all elements in nums1 (x1) and nums2 (x2).
Check the lengths of nums1 and nums2:
If the length of nums1 is odd, the XOR of nums2 contributes to the result.
If the length of nums2 is odd, the XOR of nums1 contributes to the result.
Return the combined result of these XOR operations.
This approach ensures we don't explicitly compute all pairings, keeping the solution efficient
